## ‚öôÔ∏è How It Works

1. **Continuous Monitoring:** Sensors collect gas and temperature data.
2. **Noise Filtering:** Kalman filter algorithms process inputs, enhancing detection reliability and suppressing false positives.
3. **Event Trigger:** Upon fire/gas event:
   - Sounds buzzer, takes a photo, grabs GPS position
   - Sends complete alert to the cloud (via WiFi)
   - Activates relay ‚Üí solenoid valve ‚Üí sprinkler system
4. **Advanced Networking:** Tested using different communication protocols for deployment in multi-node IoT networks; cluster-based protocols proved most efficient in terms of speed and energy.
